This is my made from scratch AI Assistant! Arni listens for commands from a user to order pizza, control a robot, play music on speakers, play youtube videos on my tv, and gives an audible response for the user to hear. He currently connects to a small robot which I have built, and can communicate (via bluetooth) commands for movements. He is a work in progress!
